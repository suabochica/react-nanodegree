                <p>An <strong>isomorphic React</strong> application (also frequently referred to as <strong>Universal React</strong>) is a web application where the same React code runs on both the server and the client browser.</p>
                <p>In a traditional Single Page Application (SPA), the server sends a blank HTML file and a large JavaScript bundle. The user sees a blank screen or loading spinner until the browser downloads, parses, and executes the JavaScript. An isomorphic architecture eliminates this delay.</p>
                <h3>How the Isomorphic Workflow Works</h3>
                <p><strong>Server-Side Render (SSR):</strong> When a user requests a page, a backend engine like Node.js executes the React component tree on the server. It converts the components into a raw HTML string using server-side functions and sends that fully-formed HTML back to the browser.</p>
                <p><strong>Immediate Visual Paint:</strong> The browser receives the pre-rendered HTML and displays it instantly. The user can read text and view layout structures immediately without experiencing a "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC).</p>
                <p><strong>Hydration:</strong> Simultaneously, the browser downloads the application's client-side JavaScript bundle. React scans the existing HTML markup and attaches event listeners (like clicks and form submits) to it. This process is called hydration.</p>
                <p><strong>Client-Side Takeover:</strong> Once hydrated, the app functions smoothly as a traditional SPA. Subsequent page navigation and state updates happen locally in the browser without full-page reloads.</p>
