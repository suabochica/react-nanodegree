# React Nanodegree, Udacity

Welcome! Our goal is to equip you with the skills you'll need to become a profesional React developer.

## What You'll Build

### Project: My Read (React fundamentals)

In this project, you will create a React application from scratch and utilize React components to manage the user interface. You’ll create a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. Using the provided Books API, you’ll search for books and add them to a bookshelf as a React component. Finally, you’ll use React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.

### Project: Would your Rather? (React & Redux)

This project will solidify your understanding of React and Redux while giving you a chance to express your creativity. You’ll practice improving the predictability of your application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

### Udacicards (React Native)

In this project, you'll use React Native to build a mobile flashcard app. Users will not only be able to create custom cards and decks, but they’ll also be able to set up notifications to remind them to study. You’ll leverage React Native components, AsyncStorage, proper styling, as well as device APIs to create a fully dynamic experience.

### What you will gain

These projects are going to give you hands-on practice building React apps, and will extend your React skillset to include Redux and React Native. Through building these projects, you will:

- Gain experience
- Learn by overcoming obstacles
- Dig into React documentation to solve problems
- Gain confidence
