# State Management

It's time to introduce three concepts in our React learning:

1. **Props:** Allow you to pass data into your components.
2. **Functional Components:** An alternative, and probably more intuitive approach to creating components.
3. **Controlled Components:** Allow you to hook up the forms in your application to your component state.

Before to start with our Contact app you should remove default files installed with `create-react-app` command.

## The Backend Server

The Contacts app project that we're building is a front-end project. However, we'll eventually be storing the contacts on a backend server. Since we're only really focusing on the front-end for this course, we've gone ahead and built this server for you so you can focus on just the React parts of this program.

The server is a simple Node/Express app that it is stored in the `contacts-app/reactnd-contacts-server2` path. Once you've started the server, you can forget about it. The Contacts project we're working on will interact with this server, but we won't ever modify any of the server code.

> ### Running Two Servers
> At this point, you should be running two different servers on your local machine:
> - Front-end development server: Accessible on **port 3000** (with `npm start` or `yarn start`)
> - Back-end server: Accessible on **port 5001** (with `node server.js`) Please be sure that both are running before moving on in this Lesson.

## Pass Data Into Components With Props

A good analogy to understand how works component `props` in React is with functions. Lets check:

```javascript
function fetchUser(username) {
    // ajax call
}

fetchUser('Edward');
```

The goal of the `fetchUser()` function is to fetch a specific user. Then, we have to tell the function which user to fetch. It is the reason why we pass the `username` parameter in the function definition. When the function is invoked, you have to pass the respective username.

In React, the same intuition you have about functions can also be applied to React components:

```javascript
function User extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return {
            <p>Username: {this.props.username}</p>
        }
    }
}

<User username='Edward'/>
```
The whole purpose of the `<User />` component is to display a user to the UI. Then we need a way to pass the user component a username so it knows which user to display. Then, we can add a custom attribute to our component and give it a value. In our component definition we can access to this value through `this.props.username`.

In fact, any attributes that are added to a component will be accessable on the `props` object from inside of that component.

### Pass Data With Props Recap

A `prop` is any input that you pass to a React component. Just like an HTML attribute, a `prop` name and value are added to the Component.

```javascript
// passing a prop to a component
<LogoutBytton text="Wanna log out?">
```

In the code above, `text` is the `prop` and the string `'Wanna log out?'` is the value.

All props are stored on the `this.props object`. So to access this `text prop` from _inside_ the component, we'd use `this.props.text`:

```javascript
// access the prop inside the component
...
render() {
    return <div>{this.prop.text}</div>
}
...
```

## Exercise Explanation

There are two ways to approach this app. The first is a bottom-up approach and
the second is a top-down approach.

## Bottom-Up Approach

The bottom-up approach involves two steps:

1. Putting all of our code into the `App./js` file and.
2. Once the app renders what you want it to render, you break that code up into different components. This is a possible approach to the first step of the bottom-up strategy:

```js
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.usersByMovie = {};

    profiles.forEach(profile => {
      const movieID = profile.favoriteMovieID;

      if (this.usersByMovie[movieID]) {
        this.usersByMovie[movieID].push(profile.userID);
      } else {
        this.usersByMovie[movieID] = [profile.userID];
      }
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">ReactND - Coding Practice</h1>
        </header>
        <h1>How Popular is Your Favorite Movie?</h1>
        <ul>
          {Object.keys(movies).map(key => {
            const userIDs = this.usersByMovie[movies[key].id];

            return (
              <li key={movies[key].id}>
                <h2>{movies[key].name}</h2>
                <h3>Liked By:</h3>

                {!userIDs ? (
                  <h4>None of the current users liked this movie</h4>
                ) : (
                  ""
                )}

                <ul>
                  {userIDs &&
                    userIDs.map(userId => {
                      return (
                        <li key={userId}>
                          <p>{users[userId].name}</p>
                        </li>
                      );
                    })}
                </ul>
              </li>
            );
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

The reason we would need to do step 2 (break down that code into components) instead of just keeping it as it is above is that this code above is hard to read, harder to maintain, and impossible to reuse.

To identify the components, we would want to break up the code into sections. For example, here's a section of the code that corresponds to a particular movie:

```js
<li key={movies[key].id}>
  <h2>{movies[key].name}</h2>
  <h3>Liked By:</h3>

  {!userIDs ? <h4>None of the current users liked this movie</h4> : ""}

  <ul>
    {userIDs &&
      userIDs.map(userId => {
        return (
          <li key={userId}>
            <p>{users[userId].name}</p>
          </li>
        );
      })}
  </ul>
</li>
```

See how the `li` element represents a movie? We can replace that entire `li` chunk with:

```js
<MovieCard
  key={id}
  users={users}
  usersWhoLikedMovie={usersByMovie[id]}
  movieInfo={movies[id]}
/>
```

Now, we can use the `MovieCard` class to render our dashboard:

```js
<ul>
  {Object.keys(movies).map(id => (
    <MovieCard
      key={id}
      users={users}
      usersWhoLikedMovie={usersByMovie[id]}
      movieInfo={movies[id]}
    />
  ))}
</ul>
```

The entire chunk above can go inside our Dashboard Component.

The list of users who liked a particular movie can either reside inside of the MovieCard Component or be its own Component. In this application, it's a matter of preference because we won't be reusing the UserList Component elsewhere and the code inside of the MovieCard Component doesn't look bloated. However, if we were also required to show a list of all users in our app, we would want to reuse the UserList Component to do that.

## Top-Down Approach

Now, the top-down approach to making this app involves identifying each component first and then starting to code. We recommend practicing this approach because it will help you later in the course, when you learn about state and your apps become more complex.

An intuitive way of breaking an app into components is to draw what you want your resulting app to look like and then to physically draw boxes around each piece of our application - take a look at this article to see an example of that: https://brotzky.co/blog/react-thinking-in-components.

### How to Know What should be a Component

Components are reusable chunks that can be nested inside of each other, like Russian nesting dolls. Each component needs to follow the Single Responsibility Principle - that is, do only 1 thing.

Oftentimes, the number of components an app should have is subjective, but it is always the case that they should follow the Single Responsibility Principle, be reusable, and manageable in size.

## Functional components

Until this point, we have used JavaScript class syntax with a render method to build out our components. Eventually, we'll be adding more methods to these classes, but for now, it's good to know that if all your components have a render method you can  use a regular old function to create your component.

> If a component is only using a `render()` method to display content, then it can be converted into a _Stateless Functional Component_.

Notice however, that we are no longer accessing the component's props by using `this` keyword. Instead, our functional component is being passed it's props as the first argument to the functions.

```js
function User(props) {
  return (
    <p>Username: {props.username}</p>
  )
}
```

### Stateless Functional Components Recap

If your component does not keep track of internal state (i.e., all it has is a `render()` method), you can declare the component as _Stateless Functional Component_.

Remember that a React component is a JavaScript function that returns HTML for rendering. As such, the following two example of a simple Email component are equivalent:

```js
class Email extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.text}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

```js
const Email = (props) => (
  <div>
    {props.text}
  </div>
);
```

In the latter example (written as an ES6 function with an implicit return), rather than accessing `props` from `this.props`, we can pass in props directly as an argument to the function itself. In turn, this regular JavaScript function can serve as the Email component's `render()` method.

## Add State To A Component

At this point you're learned:

- Creating Components
- Composing Components Together
- Passing Data to Components

However, we still have not talked about what may be the best part of React, **State Management.** Because of React's component model, we are able to encapsulate the complexity of the state management to individual components. This allow us to build a large application by building out a bunch of smaller applications -really, components–.

### State

We learned that `props` refer to attributes from parent components. In the end, props represent "read-only" data that are _immutable_.

A component's `state`, on the other hand, represents _mutable_ data that ultimately affects what is rendered on the page. State is managed internally by the component itself and is meant to change over time, commonly due to user input (e.g., clicking on a button on the page).

To encapsulate the complexity of state management to individual components, we have to add a `state` object inside the class _...not_ in the `constructor()`, to follow the [class field proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields):

```js
class User extends React.Component {
  state = {
    username: 'Tyler'
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <p>Username: {this.state.username}</p>
    )
  }
}
```

### (Warning) Props in Initial State

When defining a component's initial state, avoid initializing that state with `props`. This is an error-prone _anti-pattern_, since state will only be initialized with `props` when the component is first created.

```js
state = {
    username: props.user // anti-pattern
}
```

In the above example, if `props` are ever updated, the current state will not change unless the component is "refreshed." Using `props` to produce a component's initial state also leads to duplication of data, deviating from a dependable "source of truth."

> State is a key property of React components. Being familiar with how state is used and how state is set (and reset) will help streamline building the UI of your app.

> In our `contacts-app` example, the contacts array should be part of the `state` object because we can add or remove contact from our contacts array.

### State Recap

By having a component manage its own state, any time there are changes made to that state, React will know and _automatically_ make the necessary updates to the page.

This is one of the key benefits of using React to build UI components: when it comes to re-rendering the page, we just have to think about updating state. We don't have to keep track of exactly which parts of the page change each time there are updates. We don't need to decide how we will efficiently re-render the page. React compares the previous output and new output, determines what has changed, and makes these decisions for us. This process of determining what has changed in the previous and new outputs is called `Reconciliation`.

## Update state with setState

### How State is Set

State reflects _mutable_ information that ultimately affects rendered output, a component may also update its state throughout its lifecycle using `this.setState()`. As we've learned, when local state changes, React will trigger a re-render of the component.

> In React your UI is just a function of your state. When your UI changes your UI will automatically update accordingly.

There are two ways to use `setState()`: using an object or using a callback function. The first is to merge state updates. Consider a snippet of the following component:

```js
class Email extends React.Component {
  state = {
    subject: '',
    message: ''
  }
// ...
});
```

Though the initial state of this component contains two properties (`subject` and `message`), they can be updated independently. For example:

```js
this.setState({
  subject: 'Hello! This is a new subject'
})
```

This way, we can leave `this.state.message` as-is, but replace `this.state.subject` with a new value.

The second way we can use `setState()` is by passing in a function rather than an object. For example:

```js
this.setState((prevState) => ({
  count: prevState.count + 1
}))
```

Here, the function passed in takes a single `prevState` argument. When a component's new state depends on the previous state (i.e., we are incrementing `count` in the previous state by 1), we want to use the functional `setState()`.

The difference between the two ways is: If you are not updating the state of the component based on the previous state, then use the object set state. If not, then use the functional set state.

### `setState()` Recap

While a component can set its state when it initializes, we expect that state to change over time, usually due to user input. The component is able to change its own internal state using `this.setState()`. Each time state is changed, React knows and will call `render()` to re-render the component. This allows for fast, efficient updates to your app's UI.

## PropTypes

As we implement additional features into our app, we may soon find ourselves debugging our components more frequently. For example, what if the props that we pass to our components end up being an unintended data type (e.g. an object instead of an array). _PropTypes_ is a package that lets us define the data type we want to see right from the get-go and warn us during development if the prop that's passed to the component doesn't match what is expected.

To user PropType in our app, we need to install [prop-types](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html):

```sh
    npm install --save prop-types
```

If you are using yarn to manage package use:

```sh
    yarn add prop-type
```

Now check the next snippet to see how to use PropTypes:

```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class Email extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h3>Message: {this.props.text}</h3>
    );
  }
}

Email.propTypes = {
  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};
```

Here, we are validating that the data type of the `text` prop should be a string.

### PropTypes Recap

PropTypes is a great way to validate intended data types in our React app. Type checking our data with PropTypes helps us identify these bugs during development to ensure a smooth experience for our app's users.

## Controlled Components

Typically when you are using forms inside in a web app, the form state lives inside of the DOM. But as we have talked about, the whole point of React is to manage state inside your application more effectively. So how we handle forms in react?. We can solve this problem with _Controlled Components_.

Controlled Components are components which render a form, but the "source of truth" for the form state lives inside of the component state rather than inside of the DOM. The reason because they are called controlled components is that React is controlling the state of the form.

The next snippet shows the structure related to a controlled component:

```js
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  state = {
    email: ""
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      email: event.target.value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.email}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

The critical action to connect the form with React is assigning to the `value` attribute value of the `state` object. Then every time you update the state object, this change will reflect in the form. If we want the input field to change, we create a `handleChange()` method that uses `setState()` to update the email address. Whenever the input email change, we can call this method by passing it to the `onChange` attribute.

> The heart of React: If the state of out application changes, then our UI updates based off of that new state.

### Controlled Components Recap

Controlled components refer to components that render a form, but the "source of truth" for that form state lives inside of the component state rather than inside of the DOM. The benefits of Controlled Components are:

- Instant input validation
- Conditionally disable/enable buttons
- Enforce input formats

In our ListContacts component, not only does the component render a form, but it also controls what happens in that form based on user input. In this case, event handlers update the component's state with the user's search query. And as we've learned: any changes to React state will cause a re-render on the page, effectively displaying our live search results.

## Lesson Summary

When it comes to keeping track of data in your app, think about what will be done with that data, and what that data will look like as your user interfaces with your app. If you want your component to store _mutable_ local data, consider using `state` to hold this information. Many times, it is state that will be used to manage controlled form elements in your components.

On the other hand, if some information isn't expected to change over time, and is generally designed to be _read-only_ throughout your app, consider using `props` instead. Both `state` and `props` will generally be in the form of an object, and changes in either will trigger a re-render of the component, but they each play very different roles in your app.

We covered a lot in this lesson, and you've made great progress - great work!
